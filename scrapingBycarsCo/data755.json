This engine really punches above its weight as torque is readily available. The DSG allows normal, sport and a manual mode.\n\nIt’s like your own Playstation built-in as driving through some mountain passes proved to be an immense amount of fun. I believe this car has just the right amount of power - enough to overtake and see off slower traffic with ease but also not too much so that it's wasted.\n\nt’s a proper relaxed cruiser, all quiet and calm inside. At the same time however this big sedan can be thrown through the corners at alarming speed and it stays stable and easy to control.\n\nFeedback through the steering wheel is excellent. The car handles bumps and uneven surfaces in its stride and you feel cushioned from the road. It still has a sporty firmness.\n\nThis vehicle is in excellent condition and includes a FULL SERVICE HISTORY.\n\nFeel free to get in contact with us today.
