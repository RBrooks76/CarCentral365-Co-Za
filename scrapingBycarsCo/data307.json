My driveway included. Despite a presence in modern showrooms, the Citi recalls the pioneering days for mass-produced front-wheel drive cars, and structurally harks back to heady times of design freed from NCAP safety ratings and increasingly obese kerb weights. No surprise that this ‘final release’ iteration of the re-released Mk1 Citi (ours is numbered 084 out of 1000) still only tips the scales at a sprightly 858kg It achieves this feat by ignoring all the safety equipment now obligatory on modern cars. The only concession to crash safety, apart perhaps from safety belts, is a driver’s airbag. Forget the other six airbags, seatbelt pretensioners, ABS, EBD, ESP and the rest of the acronym army. What is does mean is that despite modest outputs of 74kW and 140Nm from the low-tech 1.6-litre eight valver, the Mk1 will sprint to 100kph in just 8.7 seconds. That’s a full second quicker than VW’s own new 1.6 litre Polo could manage – it being a chubbier product of the 21st century. Mk1 despatches the quarter-mile in 16.58 seconds, and although braking is hampered by the lack of ABS we managed respectable 100-0kph averages of 3.03 seconds and 44 metres. Low weight is as much of a boon in deceleration as it is in acceleration.","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":2538437307,"count":12,"path":"carsimages","name":"8334174","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Volkswagen","mileage":"134 000 Km","model":"Citi","new_or_used":"Used","options":"ABS, Aircon, Towbar, Alarm, Radio","price":99900,"province":"Gauteng","reference":"fx37jggp","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2008 Volkswagen Citi 1.4i Sport","transmission":"Manual","variant":"1.4i Sport","variant_short":"1.4i","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2008-Volkswagen-Citi-1.4i-Sport-Gauteng-Pretoria/8334174/","year":2008},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"5442"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8334174"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8334173","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-26.2051408,"agent_coords_1_coord":28.0630073,"agent_locality":"Johannesburg","agent_name":"Flex Motors","agent_vin_required":"2","body_type":"Sedan","body_type_code":"S/D","colour":"WHITE","commercial_type":"a","condition":"Excellent","description":"THIS  IS  A USED CAR IN A GREAT CONDITION.
