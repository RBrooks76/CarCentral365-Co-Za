Air suspension and all-wheel drive give it off-road capability. We also like the voice-command interface and the navigation system's route guidance.\n\nWe associate Mercedes-Benz with big, luxury cars, but the 2007 Mercedes-Benz ML320 CDI breaks through that image with its diesel engine and serious off-road gear. This car can go over boulder-strewn rutted dirt roads. As for its diesel engine, Mercedes-Benz does a good job of keeping it a secret. The engine runs quietly and smoothly.\n\nThe cabin of the ML320 CDI has all the luxury we would expect from a Mercedes-Benz, even if it is meant to handle wild and wooly off-roading. Of course, the seats are power-adjustable, and the windows require just one touch of the switch to go all the way up or down. And there is a bit of wood trim on the ML320, covering the lower half of the stack and leading down to the console. \n\nThis vehicle has a OneNav system installed aswell to the value of R15 000. \n\nThis vehicle is in excellent condition, the motor was replaced 20 000Km ago. (This vehicle is a private sale)\n\nFeel free to contact us today.","fuel_type":"Diesel","image":{"version":619796144,"count":9,"path":"carsimages","name":"8333791","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Mercedes-Benz","mileage":"318 000 Km","model":"ML","new_or_used":"Used","options":"","price":129995,"province":"Western Cape","reference":"","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2007 Mercedes-Benz ML 320 CDI Auto","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"320 CDI Auto","variant_short":"320","vehicle_axle_config":"4X4","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2007-Mercedes-Benz-ML-320-CDI-Auto-Western-Cape-Cape-Town/8333791/","year":2007},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"3172"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8333791"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8333790","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-26.147248,"agent_coords_1_coord":26.157544,"agent_featured":"0","agent_locality":"Lichtenburg","agent_name":"4Wheels Motor Group","agent_vin_required":"1","body_type":"SUV","body_type_code":"SUV","colour":"Silver","commercial_type":"a","condition":"Excellent","description":"Reverse Camera, Touch screen Radio, Nudge bar, Towbar Balance of 5 year/90 000 km service plan; Balance of 7 year/200 000 km warranty.
