The updated Mazda CX-5 captures the eye and the imagination with a sleek new front end design that features a signature wing extending outward from the 3D textured grille. Styled with KODO Design principles, character lines have been minimised in favour of surfaces that catch the light. Next generation technology ensures that inside you can enjoy a smoother and quieter ride, as well as more comfortable seats that support the S-curve of your spine.","finance_estimate":"Estimated monthly payment is <strong>R 11 100.00</strong> over 72 months with 10% deposit of <strong>R 63 110.00</strong> at a rate of 12% (PRIME + 3%).<br /><br />* Please note that these calculations are only estimates and must be confirmed with your finance provider.","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":1891746693,"count":8,"path":"carsimages","name":"8236485","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Mazda","mileage":"1 500 Km","model":"CX-5","new_or_used":"New","options":"Air Conditioning, Power Steering, Electronic Brake Distribution (EBD), Anti-lock Braking System (ABS), Cruise Control, Radio / CD, Rear View Camera, Security System, Air Bag, Central Locking","price":631100,"province":"Kwazulu Natal","reference":"45KECX5R778124","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2022 Mazda CX-5 2.0 Carbon Edition Auto","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"2.0 Carbon Edition Auto","variant_short":"2.0","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/new/2022-Mazda-CX-5-2.0-Carbon-Edition-Auto-Kwazulu-Natal-Durban/8236485/","year":2022},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"3182"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8236485"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8236488","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-26.092502,"agent_coords_1_coord":27.986674,"agent_locality":"Randburg","agent_name":"CMH Mazda Randburg","agent_vin_required":"0","body_type":"Double Cab Bakkie","body_type_code":"D/C","colour":"White","commercial_type":"ab","description":"For more information on this vehicle please contact 0877215217.
