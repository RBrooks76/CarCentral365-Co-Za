Safety is catered for rather nicely with the inclusion of lane change assist, blind-spot monitoring, PDC front and rear, and six airbags. This Luxury specification ups the ante with the inclusion of 360 degree cameras, swivelling rear seats, adaptive cruise control, and so much more. \n\nBalance of Hyundai's unrivalled warranty of 7 years / 200'000 and a 6 year / 90'000km service plan.\n\nDon't Miss Out, Call Us Today, or Leave Your Details and We Will Call You.\n\nFinance Can Be Arranged, Nationwide Delivery, Trade-ins Welcome, Full Service History At Agents.\n\nPrice Excludes Documentation and Registration Costs E&OE\n\nAs one of the many Motus Select Pre-owned dealerships, we pride ourselves in excellent service and offer vehicles that can be trusted and enjoyed.
