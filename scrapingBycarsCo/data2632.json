designed for the future, the fifth generation GR Supra is the thoroughbred sports car that performance enthusiasts have been waiting for.\n\nThe new GR Supra owns the road with intelligent and dynamic design. Viewed in profile, the lowest point of the bonnet flows near-horizontally to the rear of the car for an ultra-athletic stance. The low placement of the rear spoiler further facilitates the creation of a low, continuously flowing belt line. Finally, the combination of the rearward-slanting cabin silhouette and forward slanting-underbody epitomises classic sports car styling.\n\nThe new GR Supra has been designed to deliver driving pleasure and superlative performance at accessible limits. The generous power of the GR Supra comes from the straight-six cylinder 3.0Ã¢â€žâ€œ engine which is equipped with direct fuel injection, turbocharging and mated to an 8-speed automatic gearbox delivering 250 kW of power. The Supra boasts a wide rev range as well as the fitment of launch and traction control and electronically controlled Limited Slip Differential (LSD) which optimises the rear-wheel driving experience. The Sport button, sharpens the steering and throttle response as well as Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS)*comprised of MacPherson struts in front and a multi-link rear.","finance_estimate":"Estimated monthly payment is <strong>R 16 890.00</strong> over 72 months with 10% deposit of <strong>R 96 000.00</strong> at a rate of 12% (PRIME + 3%).<br /><br />* Please note that these calculations are only estimates and must be confirmed with your finance provider.","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":3079156467,"count":10,"path":"carsimages","name":"8170949","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Toyota","mileage":"9 500 Km","model":"Supra","new_or_used":"Used","options":"Radio, Security System, Rear View Camera, Air bags, Motorplan, Electric Windows, Cruise Control, Park distance control, Full service record, Radio / CD, Climate control, Air Conditioning, Alarm, Xenon lights, Central Locking, Cruise control, Aircon, Air Bag, Power Steering, Electronic Brake Distribution (EBD)","price":959990,"province":"Kwazulu Natal","reference":"2239-1001","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2021 Toyota Supra GR 3.0T","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"GR 3.0T","variant_short":"GR 3.0T","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2021-Toyota-Supra-GR-3.0T-Kwazulu-Natal-Durban/8170949/","year":2021},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"7102"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8170949"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8170951","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-29.81824745,"agent_coords_1_coord":30.86231389,"agent_locality":"Durban","agent_name":"Ezee Cars","agent_vin_required":"1","body_type":"Hatchback","body_type_code":"H/B","colour":"Red","commercial_type":"a","condition":"","description":"Motoring made Ezee","finance_estimate":"Estimated monthly payment is <strong>R 2 460.00</strong> over 72 months with 10% deposit of <strong>R 14 000.00</strong> at a rate of 12% (PRIME + 3%).<br /><br />* Please note that these calculations are only estimates and must be confirmed with your finance provider.","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":2928870322,"count":8,"path":"carsimages","name":"8170951","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Volkswagen","mileage":"150 000 Km","model":"Polo Vivo","new_or_used":"Used","options":"Air Conditioning, Power Steering, Automatic Brake System, Radio / CD, Air Bag, Central Locking, Electric Windows","price":139990,"province":"Kwazulu Natal","reference":"2239-1082","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2016 Volkswagen Polo Vivo GP 1.4 Trendline 5-dr","transmission":"Manual","variant":"GP 1.4 Trendline 5-dr","variant_short":"1.4","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2016-Volkswagen-Polo-Vivo-GP-1.4-Trendline-5-dr-Kwazulu-Natal-Durban/8170951/","year":2016},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"7102"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8170951"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8170934","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-29.935787,"agent_coords_1_coord":30.96402,"agent_locality":"New Germany","agent_name":"Key SmartBuy","agent_vin_required":"1","body_type":"Double Cab Bakkie","body_type_code":"D/C","colour":"White","commercial_type":"ab","condition":"Excellent","description":"Panelvan Body\n1 set doors - Left side\nBarn doors at rear\nTaillift\nWarranty available\nFinance can be arranged","finance_estimate":"Estimated monthly payment is <strong>R 11 790.00</strong> over 72 months with 10% deposit of <strong>R 67 000.00</strong> at a rate of 12% (PRIME + 3%).<br /><br />* Please note that these calculations are only estimates and must be confirmed with your finance provider.","fuel_type":"Diesel","image":{"version":2628084016,"count":5,"path":"carsimages","name":"8170934","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Isuzu","mileage":"340 000 Km","model":"FTR","new_or_used":"Used","options":"Full service record","price":670000,"province":"Kwazulu Natal","reference":"","search_type":"H","seller_type":"agent","title":"2017 Isuzu FTR 850 AMT F/C C/C","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"850 AMT F/C C/C","variant_short":"850 AMT","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2017-Isuzu-FTR-850-AMT-FC-CC-Kwazulu-Natal-New-Germany/8170934/","year":2017},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"5903"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8170934"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8170933","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-29.520237,"agent_coords_1_coord":31.198746,"agent_locality":"Kwazulu/natal","agent_name":"SMG Ballito","body_type":"Sedan","body_type_code":"S/D","colour":"GLACIER SILVER METALLIC","commercial_type":"a","condition":"Excellent","description":"16\" ALLOY WHEELS, SPORT LEATHER STEERING WHEEL, INT TRIM FINISHERS BLACK HIGH-GLOSS WITH HIGHLIGHT TRIM FINISHERS PEARL CHROME, PARK DISTANCE CONTROL FRONT AND REAR.
