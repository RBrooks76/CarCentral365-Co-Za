My wife has a very beautiful Freelander and we love the vehicle a lot. Itâ€™s one of the best vehicles we have ever owned, and when I came home with this Evoque and she saw it and took it for a drive around the block she wanted it immediately. (I think I may have started a bit of a problem here). To be honest I also wanted to keep it. Itâ€™s like a completely redone high tech Freelander with a mini Range Rover interior. \nThis is the top of the range Evoque, the amount of extras and luxurious comforts this car possesses are mind blowing. The huge selling point for me is obviously the extremely low mileage and the full service history from agents. To say this car has been well cared for and maintained is an understatement. Itâ€™s in brilliant condition inside and out. \nIt drives like new, looks like new, and is a really impressive example of an Evoque. This is such a fantastic family SUV, if you are in the market for a bigger family vehicle that is extremely capable off road also, please trust me and come through for a test drive in this car. This specific vehicle was owned by a doctor, itâ€™s never done any heavy off roading, and has been used since new as a Sandton 4x4. \nWHAT MAKES THIS CAR SPECIAL? \nâ€¢\tTop of the range HSE Dynamic spec\nâ€¢\tFull service history from Land Rover\nâ€¢\tOne owner from new\nâ€¢\tSatellite navigation\nâ€¢\tMeridian surround sound\nâ€¢\tAuto push boot function\nâ€¢\tAmbient lighting package\nâ€¢\tBluetooth\nâ€¢\tElectric memory seats\nâ€¢\tBrand new spare key\nâ€¢\tInterior is like new\nâ€¢\tLand Rover rubber mats plus carpets \nâ€¢\tNever seen any previous paint work\nâ€¢\tHuge panoramic roof \nAnd many many more extraâ€™s.\n","finance_estimate":"Estimated monthly payment is <strong>R 7 740.00</strong> over 72 months with 10% deposit of <strong>R 44 000.00</strong> at a rate of 12% (PRIME + 3%).<br /><br />* Please note that these calculations are only estimates and must be confirmed with your finance provider.","fuel_type":"Diesel","image":{"version":1665050042,"count":17,"path":"carsimages","name":"8279496","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Land Rover","mileage":"87 850 Km","model":"Range Rover Evoque","new_or_used":"Used","options":"","price":439950,"province":"Gauteng","reference":"Vensol","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2014 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque 2.2 SD4 HSE Dynamic Only 87 850 Km's One Owner","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"2.2 SD4 HSE Dynamic Only 87 850 Km's One Owner ","variant_short":"2.2","vehicle_axle_config":"4X4","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2014-Land-Rover-Range-Rover-Evoque-2.2-SD4-HSE-Dynamic-Only-87-850-Kms-One-Owner-Gauteng-Sandton/8279496/","year":2014},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"6450"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8279496"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8279366","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-29.113376,"agent_coords_1_coord":26.221542,"agent_featured":"2","agent_locality":"Bloemfontein","agent_name":"Lindsay Saker Audi Centre Bloemfontein","body_type":"Coupe","body_type_code":"C/P","colour":"Red","commercial_type":"a","condition":"Excellent","description":"Full service history on this low mileage Veloster\nThis Veloster passes through a full 80-point mechanical check before delivery\nDelivery nationwide with no extra charges\nFinance available through all major finance houses\nFactory fitted extras: Leather seats, cruise control, park distance control, reverse camera and much more","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":345317475,"count":19,"path":"carsimages","name":"8279366","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Hyundai","mileage":"132 000 Km","model":"Veloster","new_or_used":"Used","options":"ABS, Aircon, Alloy Wheels, Bluetooth, Central Locking, Cruise Control, Electric Mirrors, Electric Windows, Leather Trim, Park Distance Control, Power Steering, Radio/CD, Rear view camera, USB Port, Front Fog Lamps, Steering Wheel Controls, Daytime Driving Lights, Airbags, Electronic Brake Force Distribution (EBD), Leather steering wheel, Rev counter","price":159900,"province":"Free State","reference":"5820","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2013 Hyundai Veloster 1.6 GDi Executive","transmission":"Manual","variant":"1.6 GDi Executive","variant_short":"1.6 GDi","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2013-Hyundai-Veloster-1.6-GDi-Executive-Free-State-Bloemfontein/8279366/","year":2013},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"1373"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8279366"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8279368","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-26.101463,"agent_coords_1_coord":28.072243,"agent_featured":"2","agent_locality":"Sandton","agent_name":"Lindsay Saker Audi Centre Sandton","body_type":"Sedan","body_type_code":"S/D","colour":"Black","commercial_type":"a","condition":"Demo","description":"Trade-ins accepted.
