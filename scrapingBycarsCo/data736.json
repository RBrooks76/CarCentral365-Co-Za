Late in 2015 year the tiny off-roader got connected to the 21st century by receiving Bluetooth for hands-free telephony and audio streaming. At the same time the upgraded sound system acquired RDS functionality for the radio and MP3 compatibility for the CD player, a USB port with Android and Apple device compatibility, and an auxiliary input socket.\n\nThis newly-acquired musical functionality is bundled into a Pioneer sound system with a large and fairly easy to use head unit featuring real buttons, instead of a touch-screen which can sometimes be finicky to use. A bit of a party atmosphere is created by the head unit lighting up like a disco in constantly changing colours (which is surprisingly not too driver-distracting).\n\nThis vehicle is in excellent condition and a FULL SERVICE HISTORY is included.","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":1434584163,"count":8,"path":"carsimages","name":"8318267","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Suzuki","mileage":"75 000 Km","model":"Jimny","new_or_used":"Used","options":"","price":239995,"province":"Western Cape","reference":"555","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2016 Suzuki Jimny 1.3","transmission":"Manual","variant":"1.3","variant_short":"1.3","vehicle_axle_config":"4X4","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2016-Suzuki-Jimny-1.3-Western-Cape-Cape-Town/8318267/","year":2016},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"3172"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8318267"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8318266","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-33.947029,"agent_coords_1_coord":25.554508,"agent_locality":"Port Elizabeth","agent_name":"JW Auto","agent_vin_required":"1","body_type":"Sedan","body_type_code":"S/D","colour":"White","commercial_type":"a","condition":"Excellent","description":"New in stock..  2018 Toyota Corolla 1.4D Prestige .. \nAll our Pre-Owned Vehicles undergo a stringent Multi-Point Check and Dekra Roadworthy before Delivery.\nWe Deliver Countrywide l Trade-ins Accepted l Finance also Available with all major Banks and a Test Drive is a must.
