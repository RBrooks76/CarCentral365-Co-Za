The 944 S2 had the same rounded nose and a rear valance found on the Turbo model. It was available until 1992. \nFinished in guards red, one of Porsches most famous colours it is a real beauty. The paintwork on the car is in fair condition for the age and mileage, with only some minor stone chips on the front end and a slight imperfection on the leading edge of the driver’s door. \n\nNo major blemishes are visible on the alloy wheels. Over 7mm of tread remains across all four tyres.\n\nMoving inside, the cabin presents very well, with the black leather in a good condition it does have some minor age-related creasing on the seats and a little wear on some of the main touchpoints, including the gear knob.
