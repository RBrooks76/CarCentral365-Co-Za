Here is an example of the finest Bentleys, the 30’s cars. Hand built, bespoke, built to last forever, this is a 1936 Derby Bentley with bodywork by Hooper. It presents itself well and is on the button. Its an original example and would be a worthy addition to any collection. Combine this with the fact that it is a moveable asset of international worth and the car needs strong consideration. delivered to Archibald Blair in April of 1937, the vehicle found its way to the colonies some time after the war, beginning in Rhodesia, it has spent most of its subsequent life in the Transvaal, being TG 1985 for many years, then SJK123T. The Hooper body is particularly attractive, being not as austere as some of the other bodybuilders and constructed almost entirely out of aluminum.
