In my opinion, the Chinese manufacturers are now where the Koreans were 10 years ago when they launched the new generation KIA SPORTAGE and HYUNDAI IX35. They were making a good quality product at an affordable price. The Koreans are still making a good product but the price is no longer so affordable with their entry level S.U.Vs selling for over R400 000. Enter the JAC. It is just such a GOOD LOOKING BAKKIE ALL THE MODERN FEATURES AND LUXURIES INCLUDING TOUCH SCREEN INFOTAINMENT WITH FULLY INTEGRATED SMART PHONE CONNECTIVITY AND FULL LEATHER PACKAGE. Additional standard extras include Side steps, Roll bar, Rubberized bin etc. etc. Just such a beautiful looking DOUBLE CAB. Make no mistake, the build quality and overall feel of this vehicle is also brilliant. WITH NOW OVER 60 DEALERS COUNTRYWIDE AND GROWING , JAC IS HERE TO STAY. The bakkie comes with a 5 YEAR 60 000KM SERVICE PLAN AND A 5 YEAR150 000 KM factory warranty which equals 100 peace of mind motoring We have a fully accredited JAC workshop on site to cater for all your parts and maintenance needs.
