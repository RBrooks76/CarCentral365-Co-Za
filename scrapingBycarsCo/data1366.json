is typical of BMW design, and everything falls to hand. Shifts from the 6-speed manual gearbox are crisp and relatively short throw. Clutch take-up is friendly even to beginners and pedal resistance is light – a positive in heavy traffic. Weaving through traffic, the chassis begins to come to life. The car is nimble and easy to thread along congested roads. At first, the car feels larger than it really is thanks to your view over the hood, peering over the bulbous and muscular hood and fenders. After spending a few minutes in traffic however, it shrinks in size and perhaps feels more compact than its actual dimensions – a compliment to any car’s handling dynamics.","finance_estimate":"Estimated monthly payment is <strong>R 2 820.00</strong> over 72 months with 10% deposit of <strong>R 16 000.00</strong> at a rate of 12% (PRIME + 3%).<br /><br />* Please note that these calculations are only estimates and must be confirmed with your finance provider.","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":18380760,"count":19,"path":"carsimages","name":"8288917","extension":".jpg"},"make":"BMW","mileage":"124 083 Km","model":"1 Series","new_or_used":"Used","options":"Break assist, Multifunction steering wheel, Spot Lights, Adaptive Cruise Control, Air Bags, Air Conditioning, Central Locking, Climate Control, Cupholders, Front & Rear Electric Windows, Traction Control","price":159995,"province":"Western Cape","reference":"0207-951273","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2012 BMW 1 Series 118i 5-dr","transmission":"Manual","variant":"118i 5-dr","variant_short":"118i","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2012-BMW-1-Series-118i-5-dr-Western-Cape-Tokai/8288917/","year":2012},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"7092"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8288917"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8288996","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-32.984227,"agent_coords_1_coord":27.898947,"agent_locality":"East London","agent_name":"Nissan East London","body_type":"SUV","body_type_code":"SUV","colour":"Blue","commercial_type":"a","condition":"","description":"the elegantly stylish family cross over with all the wants and needs , remainder of factory warranty and service plan","finance_estimate":"Estimated monthly payment is <strong>R 7 210.00</strong> over 72 months with 10% deposit of <strong>R 41 000.00</strong> at a rate of 12% (PRIME + 3%).<br /><br />* Please note that these calculations are only estimates and must be confirmed with your finance provider.","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":3539883547,"count":17,"path":"carsimages","name":"8288996","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Nissan","mileage":"2 699 Km","model":"Qashqai","new_or_used":"Used","options":"Bluetooth Radio, Break assist, Day time running lights, Forward collision warning, Hill assist, Mag Wheels, Multifunction steering wheel, Navigation, Adjustable Steering Column, Adjustable Steering Wheel, Air Bags, Air Conditioning, Alloy Wheels, Anti Lock Brakes, Auto On Headlights, CD Autochanger, Central Locking, Climate Control, Cruise Control, Cupholders, Curtain Airbags, Driver Airbag","price":409996,"province":"Eastern Cape","reference":"0225-946161","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2021 Nissan Qashqai 1.2T Midnight Auto","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"1.2T Midnight Auto","variant_short":"1.2T","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2021-Nissan-Qashqai-1.2T-Midnight-Auto-Eastern-Cape-East-London/8288996/","year":2021},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"3657"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8288996"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8288997","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-32.984227,"agent_coords_1_coord":27.898947,"agent_locality":"East London","agent_name":"Nissan East London","body_type":"SUV","body_type_code":"SUV","colour":"Red","commercial_type":"a","condition":"","description":"spacious 7 seater vehicle ,where adults are able to sit in the 3rd row of seats and not just kids","finance_estimate":"Estimated monthly payment is <strong>R 3 520.00</strong> over 72 months with 10% deposit of <strong>R 20 000.00</strong> at a rate of 12% (PRIME + 3%).<br /><br />* Please note that these calculations are only estimates and must be confirmed with your finance provider.","fuel_type":"Diesel","image":{"version":2727649940,"count":18,"path":"carsimages","name":"8288997","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Mahindra","mileage":"103 868 Km","model":"XUV 500","new_or_used":"Used","options":"Bluetooth Radio, Day time running lights, Mag Wheels, Multifunction steering wheel, 12v Socket, Air Bags, Air Conditioning, Alloy Wheels, Bluetooth Preparation (Other), Cloth Upholstery, Cruise Control, Curtain Airbags, Driver Airbag, Electric Door Mirrors, Front & Rear Electric Windows, Fuel Computer","price":199996,"province":"Eastern Cape","reference":"0225-943179","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2016 Mahindra XUV 500 2.2D mHawk 7-seat W8","transmission":"Manual","variant":"2.2D mHawk 7-seat W8","variant_short":"2.2D","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2016-Mahindra-XUV-500-2.2D-mHawk-7-seat-W8-Eastern-Cape-East-London/8288997/","year":2016},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"3657"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8288997"}}]
