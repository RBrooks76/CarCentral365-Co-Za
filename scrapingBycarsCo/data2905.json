This is a vehicle not to be missed  - You can either drop gears yourself using the steering-wheel shift paddles or (our preferred option) leaving the quick-acting dual-clutch 'box to its own devices. Either way the performance is great. The Volkswagen Arteon is a radical design compared to other vehicles in the Volkswagen portfolio. There is a lot of shared technology, modular architecture and is renowned for its practicality and compliant ride quality. There is also ample cabin space.\nPassengers have excellent legroom and the luggage bay is practically shaped for extra luggage. The Volkswagen Arteon truly shines in the standard features and technology departments. There are two trim levels available. The R-Line steering wheel features audio and cruise control functionality, as well as controlling the views of the standard digital instrument panel, known as Active Info Display.\nClimate control is standard too. The standout feature is the 9.2-inch Navigation Pro infotainment system that boasts both Android Auto and Apple Carplay functionality. Those who buy an Arteon will be impressed by its levels of comfort and technology and notable engine performance. With a full Dekra condition and roadworthy report, all you need to do is Test drive this vehicle to make up your mind.
