It goes without saying the new C-Class has the highest safety rating of five stars. \nNew Mercedes C-Class is larger than the E-Class of a couple of generations back. Such is the march of progress that it's also smoother, quieter and more powerful than its well regarded ancestor. \nThe diesel 2.1-litre C220 model makes 125kW/400Nm and goes to 100km/h in 8.1sec. It has a claimed fuel combined consumption of four litres/100km and 113g/km CO2 emissions.\nHandling is impeccable, with so much in hand that only the most undisciplined of drivers is even remotely likely to get into trouble. Even then, the ham-fisted driver will have found their car doing everything it could to bring matters under control again. \nThis specific C220 has the following Extras\nAvantgarde interior, Avantgarde exterior, Parking package, Mirror package, Reversing camera, Blind spot assist, Active parking assist with Parktronic, Windscreen wiper with rain sensor, 9G-Tronic, Electrically folding exterior mirrors, LED Intelligent Light   System and Boot auto closing.\n\nFinance available and\nTrade ins welcome","fuel_type":"Diesel","image":{"version":2565538131,"count":13,"path":"carsimages","name":"8280300","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Mercedes-Benz","mileage":"135 000 Km","model":"C-Class","new_or_used":"Used","options":"","price":339900,"province":"Western Cape","reference":"","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2017 Mercedes-Benz C-Class C 220 Bluetec Avantgarde Auto","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"C 220 Bluetec Avantgarde Auto","variant_short":"C 220","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2017-Mercedes-Benz-C-Class-C-220-Bluetec-Avantgarde-Auto-Western-Cape-Strand/8280300/","year":2017},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"3558"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8280300"}}]
