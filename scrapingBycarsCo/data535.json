AUTO, ONLY 99 850 KM'S, FULL SERVICE HISTORY, IMMACULATE CONDITION, ONLY R 519 950.00\n\nThis is my favourite time of year, summer time means it’s almost holiday time, and I couldn’t think of a better holiday vehicle than the Caravelle, its light on fuel, drives brilliantly and has plenty of space coupled with lots of luxury. This is one of VW most reliable motors, the 2.0 TDI, this is also the 7 speed DSG gear box version. She drives like a car. Please don’t confuse this Caravelle with its siblings the Kombi and the transporter, there is no comparison, the Caravelle is the top of the range VW People carrier. \nYou will not find a more gorgeous looking Caravelle on the internet at the moment, I simply love what the previous owner has done to it. \n\nWHAT MAKES THIS CAR SO SPECIAL? \n\n•\tHigh quality full vehicle wrap (original colour is Champaign)\n•\tOZ aftermarket alloy rims, I must say the improvement is huge, this is what a Caravelle is supposed to look like, I’m not a fan of the original wheels to be honest. \n•\tThis is one of the only ones on the internet with such low mileage\n•\tFull service history, every service completed on time and up to date, only the last two services were not from VW.\n•\tInterior is like new \n•\tElectric windows\n•\tCruise control\n•\tHeated seats\n•\tSpecial tray which ads extra storage and a driving table \n\nThis vehicle is one for the books, and I would love to buy this exact car for my family and our holidays, I can actually see myself driving through Kruger in this, or should I rather say being driven through the Kruger Park, the rear is where you want to be in this car, it’s fit for a king. \n","finance_estimate":"Estimated monthly payment is <strong>R 9 150.00</strong> over 72 months with 10% deposit of <strong>R 52 000.00</strong> at a rate of 12% (PRIME + 3%).<br /><br />* Please note that these calculations are only estimates and must be confirmed with your finance provider.","fuel_type":"Diesel","image":{"version":3959957552,"count":23,"path":"carsimages","name":"8326656","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Volkswagen","mileage":"99 850 Km","model":"Caravelle","new_or_used":"Used","options":"","price":519950,"province":"Gauteng","reference":"Vensol","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2014 Volkswagen Caravelle T5 2.0 BiTDI Auto, Only 99 850 Km's","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"T5 2.0 BiTDI Auto, Only 99 850 Km's ","variant_short":"2.0 BiTDI","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2014-Volkswagen-Caravelle-T5-2.0-BiTDI-Auto-Only-99-850-Kms-Gauteng-Sandton/8326656/","year":2014},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"6450"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8326656"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8326655","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-25.748757,"agent_coords_1_coord":28.197747,"agent_locality":"Pretoria","agent_name":"GI Motors","agent_vin_required":"2","body_type":"Sedan","body_type_code":"S/D","colour":"GOLD","commercial_type":"a","description":"First come, first serve!!!
