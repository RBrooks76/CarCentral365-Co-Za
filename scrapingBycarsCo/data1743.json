thing as too much of a good thing, right? If this is your personal mantra, Toyota has an SUV for you: the Land Cruiser. It's big. It's powerful. It's comfortable. It's got brand cachet. It hauls people and cargo through rough terrain just as easily as it hauls them to the local movie theater. The Toyota Land Cruiser doesn't skimp on anything.\nThe Toyota Land Cruiser offers some of the best on-road performance of any vehicle in this segment. Its long wheelbase contributes to a supple ride that is well damped at all four corners, and its steering is nicely balanced and weighted for such a heavy vehicle. This Toyota SUV is able to tackle the hardest terrain without breaking a sweat. What's more, this ability doesn't hamper the vehicles level of control and ease of operation on the freeway and two-lane roads. The Land Cruiser faces stiff competition from several luxury vehicles but this vehicle can easily hold its own in this setting, the 2006 Toyota Land Cruiser is also backed by something its competitors can't simply engineer into their vehicles -- Toyota's legendary reputation for quality and dependability.","fuel_type":"Diesel","image":{"version":1850446659,"count":8,"path":"carsimages","name":"8262908","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Toyota","mileage":"223 000 Km","model":"Prado","new_or_used":"Used","price":199995,"province":"Western Cape","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2006 Toyota Prado 3.0 TDI VX Auto","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"3.0 TDI VX Auto","variant_short":"3.0 TDI","vehicle_axle_config":"4X4","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2006-Toyota-Prado-3.0-TDI-VX-Auto-Western-Cape-Cape-Town/8262908/","year":2006},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"3172"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8262908"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8262907","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-25.771982,"agent_coords_1_coord":29.47296,"agent_featured":"2","agent_locality":"Middelburg","agent_name":"4 Wheels Cars Middelburg","agent_vin_required":"1","body_type":"Double Cab Bakkie","body_type_code":"D/C","colour":"White","commercial_type":"ab","condition":"Excellent","description":"","finance_estimate":"Estimated monthly payment is <strong>R 12 310.00</strong> over 72 months with 10% deposit of <strong>R 69 990.00</strong> at a rate of 12% (PRIME + 3%).<br /><br />* Please note that these calculations are only estimates and must be confirmed with your finance provider.","fuel_type":"Diesel","image":{"version":4277440210,"count":10,"path":"carsimages","name":"8262907","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Toyota","mileage":"85 000 Km","model":"Hilux","new_or_used":"Used","options":"Towbar, Radio, Air bags, Electric Windows, Leather seats, Park distance control, Alarm, Cruise control, Aircon, ABS","price":699900,"province":"Mpumalanga","reference":"3893","search_type":"B","seller_type":"agent","title":"2019 Toyota Hilux 2.8 GD-6 Raider 4x4 Auto Double-Cab","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"2.8 GD-6 Raider 4x4 Auto Double-Cab","variant_short":"2.8","vehicle_axle_config":"4X4","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2019-Toyota-Hilux-2.8-GD-6-Raider-4x4-Auto-Double-Cab-Mpumalanga-Middelburg/8262907/","year":2019},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"5002"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8262907"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8262903","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-26.103076,"agent_coords_1_coord":27.97674,"agent_locality":"Randburg","agent_name":"Willowcrest Motors","agent_vin_required":"0","body_type":"SUV","body_type_code":"SUV","colour":"WHITE","commercial_type":"a","condition":"Excellent","description":"STOCK NO - 15314 - DEKRA TESTED - BRAND NEW TYRES - Service History - Smash & Grab - Leather - Keyless Entry  - Navigation - Bluetooth - Navigation - Reverse Camera - 7 Seater - Excellent Condition - Finance Arranged - . . .
