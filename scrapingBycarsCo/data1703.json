And what makes this vehicle different - the cabin quality is better, 2 individual seats in the front, conventional handbrake. There's an all-new touchscreen infotainment system, rear parking sensors but the significant change is the safety features. The driver's airbag has been joined by a 2nd airbag for the front passenger and crucially, an anti-lock braking system has been fitted.  The great news is that the new Go feels more solidly assembled and -finished. The gear action is light and smooth. In terms of interior quality it is much more comfortable and neat and well rounded off. Overall this little vehicle has had a good make over and is very economical. Very comfortable for the entire family. A full Dekra condition and roadworthy. price does not include dealership fees and smash and grab. More images to follow.
