From perfecting the rotary engine and winning Le Mans the first time we entered it, to breaking the world record for the most-sold two-seater convertible in history, Mazda has a long history of making the impossible possible.

This desire is the fuel behind everything we create and achieve and now it has given us SKYACTIV TECHNOLOGY, ‘KODO – Soul of Motion’ design and countless other successes that were once considered impossible feats.
