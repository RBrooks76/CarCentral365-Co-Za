It’s the largest volume seller locally, and as the one-ton transport and logistics solution to most mining operations, small business enterprises and rural South Africa’s famers, Hilux is a vital cog in the economic dynamism of the country. The turbodiesel 3.0 D-4D retains its strong torque characteristics, serving up 343Nm from 1 400r/min. It runs quietly and smoothly in combination with the four-speed auto. Off-road the four-speed auto and two-pedal convenience is sure to appeal to novice off-roaders, or those who often drive trails in convoy and enjoy impromptu stops on gradient surfaces.\nBut Hilux 4x4s are also bought for their off-road capabilities and we would never argue with what they can do. D-4Ds are used, for example, with slight suspension modifications and special wheels, to set the route for the Dakar Rally. They are otherwise dead standard, as driven off South American showroom floors. Can’t argue with that.\n\nThis specific Hilux has a Beekman Executive Canopy and the popular Hannibal Roof rack, It also has long range fuel tank and dual battery system. This Hilux has just been serviced by Rola Toyota and is ready to take you on an adventure.\n\nFinance available and\nTrade ins welcome.","fuel_type":"Diesel","image":{"version":949552434,"count":11,"path":"carsimages","name":"8318472","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Toyota","mileage":"257 000 Km","model":"Hilux","new_or_used":"Used","options":"","price":279900,"province":"Western Cape","reference":"","search_type":"B","seller_type":"agent","title":"2010 Toyota Hilux 3.0 D-4D Raider 4x4 Auto Double-Cab","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"3.0 D-4D Raider 4x4 Auto Double-Cab","variant_short":"3.0","vehicle_axle_config":"4X4","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2010-Toyota-Hilux-3.0-D-4D-Raider-4x4-Auto-Double-Cab-Western-Cape-Strand/8318472/","year":2010},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"3558"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8318472"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8318471","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-26.7063885,"agent_coords_1_coord":27.83607019,"agent_featured":"2","agent_locality":"Vanderbijlpark","agent_name":"Auto Investments VDBP","agent_vin_required":"1","body_type":"Single Cab Bakkie","body_type_code":"S/C","colour":"BRONZE","commercial_type":"ab","condition":"Excellent","description":"** MINT CONDITION **\nSERVICE HISTORY @ TOYOTA WITH BOOKS & S/KEY.\nCHROME SIDE STEPS.\nT/BAR.\nROLL BAR.\nNAVIGATION.\nLEATHER SEATS.\nCRUISE CONTROL.\nBLUETOOTH.\nCALL RUDI NOW FOR MORE INFO!!","finance_estimate":"Estimated monthly payment is <strong>R 8 080.00</strong> over 72 months with 10% deposit of <strong>R 45 950.00</strong> at a rate of 12% (PRIME + 3%).<br /><br />* Please note that these calculations are only estimates and must be confirmed with your finance provider.","fuel_type":"Diesel","image":{"version":2801635473,"count":11,"path":"carsimages","name":"8318471","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Toyota","mileage":"153 000 Km","model":"Hilux","new_or_used":"Used","price":459500,"province":"Gauteng","reference":"CALL RUDI 084 804 2054","search_type":"B","seller_type":"agent","title":"2019 Toyota Hilux 2.8 GD-6 Raised Body Raider Auto Extended Cab","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"2.8 GD-6 Raised Body Raider Auto Extended Cab","variant_short":"2.8","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2019-Toyota-Hilux-2.8-GD-6-Raised-Body-Raider-Auto-Extended-Cab-Gauteng-Vanderbijlpark/8318471/","year":2019},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"108"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8318471"}}]
