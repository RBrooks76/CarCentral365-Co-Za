With a roomier cabin, the most noticeable additions here are subtle red stitching, a facia trim and comfortable sports seats with an excellent finish. Options here include Discover Media navigation (R12 150), the second-generation version of VW’s superb active info display (R8 650), a panoramic sunroof (R10 550) and leather upholstery with heating for the front pews (R9 850). \n\nGiven the Polo GTI's performance, the promise of more than 50mpg fuel economy is impressive. It's worth remembering that in any car – especially performance models – you're unlikely to come close to the claimed figures if you exploit the car's potential to the full.","finance_estimate":"Estimated monthly payment is <strong>R 7 390.00</strong> over 72 months with 10% deposit of <strong>R 41 990.00</strong> at a rate of 12% (PRIME + 3%).<br /><br />* Please note that these calculations are only estimates and must be confirmed with your finance provider.","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":2715508905,"count":16,"path":"carsimages","name":"8287446","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Volkswagen","mileage":"42 000 Km","model":"Polo","new_or_used":"Used","options":"Air Conditioning, Power Steering, Electronic Brake Distribution (EBD), Anti-lock Braking System (ABS), Cruise Control, Radio / CD, Rear View Camera, Security System, Air Bag, Central Locking, Sun roof","price":419900,"province":"Gauteng","reference":"86WHUSDR095105","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2019 Volkswagen Polo 2.0 GTI Auto (147kW)","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"2.0 GTI Auto (147kW)","variant_short":"2.0 GTI","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2019-Volkswagen-Polo-2.0-GTI-Auto-147kW-Gauteng-Johannesburg/8287446/","year":2019},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"2565"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8287446"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8287411","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-26.119747,"agent_coords_1_coord":28.22803,"agent_locality":"Kempton Park","agent_name":"Hyundai Airport (Kempton Park)","body_type":"Hatchback","body_type_code":"H/B","colour":"POLAR WHITE","commercial_type":"a","condition":"","description":"i20 1.2 MOTION M/T MY21 It is fuel efficient and had one owner.
