The 993 represented the last of the air cooled 911 and was much improved, making it quite different from its predecessor the 964. According to Porsche, every part of the car was taken back to the drawing board and redesigned. This included the engine and only 20% of its parts were carried over from the 964. Porsche said that the 993 was “a significant advance” over the previous 964 both technically and visually. The 993 Turbo was the first production 911 Turbo from Porsche with twin turbo technology and an All-wheel Drive system. Standard engine power was 408HP, with a 430HP and 450HP upgrade available from the factory or as a retro fit. This specific car is a 1998 Porsche 993 Turbo with only 98500 kms on from new and a comprehensive service history from Porsche SA and Porsche Specialists GT ONE. It is finished in metallic blue with Metropol Grey extended leather interior package & Carbon fiber trim on steering wheel, dash and door panels. The car also has a number of factory fitted options including a sunroof, third brake light, Turbo S front spot lights, rear window wiper, coloured wheel centre caps, aluminium gear shift knob and handbrake lever, xenon headlights. This must be one of the best examples of this very significant car in the 911 Turbo lineage. A great opportunity to own a truly iconic Porsche Turbo! Please take note this vehicle can be viewed by appointment only! This vehicle has a FSH, Spare key. This Vehicle is accident Free! All our vehicles undergo a full quality check in our 5 Star RMI approved workshop, we are also registered with the Motor Industry Ombudsman.
