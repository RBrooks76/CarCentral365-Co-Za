We certainly think so as not only is the Renault Kwid the physical embodiment of modern French driving, but it is also just as much at home roaring down the highway as it is darting gracefully through the traffic of even the most gridlocked South African cities. It’s robust, yet fun design is 100% technology-driven and this amazingly French vehicle is perfectly suited for South African car lovers who are young or simply young at heart. With its bold, perfectly structured grille that highlights the now legendary Renault diamond logo, this is probably the most affordable piece of sexy French automotive machinery to ever to hit the roads of Africa (and indeed the world).\n\nEverything from the signature Renault headlights and stylish chrome trim on the outside, to the horizontal uncluttered lines of the luxurious vehicle interior boldly proclaim this to be a car of the people, and one that is most certainly not skimping on good looks and abundant sex appeal.\n\nSo don’t hesitate a moment longer, take control of your destiny and book a test drive of the all new, very affordable Renault Kwid!","finance_estimate":"Estimated monthly payment is <strong>R 2 950.00</strong> over 72 months with 10% deposit of <strong>R
