no doubt this is the best Hilux Toyota has produced. It’s an impressive all-rounder with a real ‘can do’ attitude when you press it to do what it was primarily designed to do – work hard. \n\nThe Toyota Hilux Legend 50 has a couple of upgrades which you might like: The front upper and lower grille has received the full black-out treatment (in gloss finish), with matching stylised fog-lamp surrounds. A stylish silver accent line frames the vertical fog-lamp garnish with a matching silver lower bumper guard. Legend 50 badging, offset to the left, rounds off the front façade, complemented by the LED headlamps incorporating Daytime Running Lights (DRL).\n\nThe side profile is enhanced by black side protective mouldings (X/C and D/C), chrome exterior mirrors and door handles as well as black side steps. A customised rear styling bar with matching Legend 50 badging and a textured, heavy-duty tonneau cover add rugged appeal. Sleek satin-silver roof rails (X/C and D/C) elevate Legend 50’s presence.\n\nIn the rear, a black rear bumper, smoked taillamps and tailgate badging, complete the visual package. A low-profile towbar is fitted as standard – enhancing utility.\n\nThe wheel and tyre package consist of Legend 50-specific two-tone 18” alloy wheels shod with 265-60-R18 all-terrain tyres.\n\nThe interior receives black leather seat trim with blue stitching for a more premium feel, while the chrome touches on the exterior are mirrored by a strip across the dashboard. A 4.2-inch TFT screen behind the steering wheel shares trip information with the driver, while the white dials have orange needles.\n\nAlso upgraded is the infotainment system, which now has an 8-inch display that is flush mounted. A nice touch, which shows that Toyota listens to customer feedback, is that the volume rotary dial is back, for better ease of use.\n\nLegend models come with a full suite of active and passive safety features – including driver, passenger, knee and curtain airbags (body-type dependent). ABS, VSC, EBD, Brake Assist and Hill-assist Control round off the electronic safety aids.\n\nThis vehicle comes with FULL SERVICE HISTORY included.\n\nFeel free to contact us about the gorgeous work horse today!","fuel_type":"Diesel","image":{"version":3241027951,"count":8,"path":"carsimages","name":"8127035","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Toyota","mileage":"38 000 Km","model":"Hilux","new_or_used":"Used","options":"","price":679995,"province":"Western Cape","reference":"","search_type":"B","seller_type":"agent","title":"2020 Toyota Hilux 2.8 GD-6 Raised Body Legend Auto Double-Cab","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"2.8 GD-6 Raised Body Legend Auto Double-Cab","variant_short":"2.8","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2020-Toyota-Hilux-2.8-GD-6-Raised-Body-Legend-Auto-Double-Cab-Western-Cape-Cape-Town/8127035/","year":2020},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"3172"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8127035"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8127029","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-25.771982,"agent_coords_1_coord":29.47296,"agent_featured":"2","agent_locality":"Middelburg","agent_name":"4 Wheels Cars Middelburg","agent_vin_required":"1","body_type":"Cabriolet","body_type_code":"C/B","colour":"BLUE","commercial_type":"a","condition":"Excellent","description":"","finance_estimate":"Estimated monthly payment is <strong>R 12 310.00</strong> over 72 months with 10% deposit of <strong>R 69 990.00</strong> at a rate of 12% (PRIME + 3%).<br /><br />* Please note that these calculations are only estimates and must be confirmed with your finance provider.","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":1478981845,"count":17,"path":"carsimages","name":"8127029","extension":".jpg"},"make":"BMW","mileage":"72 000 Km","model":"M3","new_or_used":"Used","options":"Aircon, Leather seats, Electric Windows, Radio","price":699900,"province":"Mpumalanga","reference":"3936","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2014 BMW M3 Convertible Auto","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"Convertible Auto","variant_short":"Convertible","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2014-BMW-M3-Convertible-Auto-Mpumalanga-Middelburg/8127029/","year":2014},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"5002"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8127029"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8127023","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-25.70189,"agent_coords_1_coord":28.20025,"agent_locality":"Pretoria","agent_name":"SA Multi Franchise Motor Group","agent_vin_required":"1","body_type":"Double Cab Bakkie","body_type_code":"D/C","colour":"White","commercial_type":"ab","condition":"Excellent","description":"Description: Modifications\t\nAccessories\tSpot Lights, Tow Bar, Smash And Grab, Rubberised, Running Boards, Mag / Alloy Rims,\nExtra Accessories\tintensity spots. bin carrier. bar light. roof rack. syspention\nExellent Condition Part of the SA Multi-Franchise Motor Group Recommendation- we will arrange pre approved finance in need be This is a one of a kind vehicle, very clean and well maintained.
