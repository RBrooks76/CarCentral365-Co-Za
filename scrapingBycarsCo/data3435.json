Overall the new design has helped make the CR-V look less bulky and more athletic.\nOther updates to the CR-V occur under the skin and include improvements to the ride and comfort levels, and a decrease in noise and vibrations within the cabin.\nThere's not much in the compact SUV category that can match the CR-V for space. It has a huge boot at 556-Litres and the rear seats can be folded flat to offer more loading space. Rear room is excellent.\nStandard equipment on the CR-V is commendable and once you factor that into the price the CR-V becomes an even more attractive offering. Front and rear parking sensors and climate control are also standard as is the seven-inch touchscreen that controls audio and media functions. There's a cool economy measurement chart that compares current drive to previous drives and personal best consumption. The overall functionality is good and it does all its jobs well, plus there's an HDMI port.\nThe Honda CR-V ranks safety highly on its priority list and its standard safety equipment includes six airbags, ABS, EBD, traction and stability control as well as ISOFIX seat anchors in the rear.\nIt's quite difficult to pick rivals for the Honda CR-V 2.0 as it actually occupies a bit of niche within the segment. Most entry spec compact SUVs are going the small capacity turbocharged route and the higher end ones are automatic and diesel so the CR-V 2.0 sits somewhere in the middle. We see the buyer as someone who wants the confirmed reliability of a naturally-aspirated engine, but doesn't want to skimp on specification levels. \n\nFinance available and\nTrade ins welcome.","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":136528692,"count":12,"path":"carsimages","name":"7920343","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Honda","mileage":"80 000 Km","model":"CR-V","new_or_used":"Used","options":"","price":249900,"province":"Western Cape","reference":"","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2015 Honda CR-V 2.0 Comfort Auto","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"2.0 Comfort Auto","variant_short":"2.0","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2015-Honda-CR-V-2.0-Comfort-Auto-Western-Cape-Strand/7920343/","year":2015},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"3558"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/7920343"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"7920342","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-28.7736224,"agent_coords_1_coord":31.9024826,"agent_locality":"Richards Bay","agent_name":"Quality Cars","agent_vin_required":"1","body_type":"SUV","body_type_code":"SUV","colour":"Gold","commercial_type":"a","condition":"Excellent","description":"URBAN AUTOMOTIVE WHEELS WORTH 100K.
